# Toast Engine / YeahToast!

Hello, well-done bread lovers!

What began as a little experiment in graphics with Python, I am developing into my own full 2D game engine using PyGame, with physics, graphics, buttons, and sounds galore!

The engine features Newtonian kinematics and an adorably toasty theme!  It is a work in progress, and as I progress I will be developing games based on the engine, including the eponymous platformer concept for this repository, YeahToast!
