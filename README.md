# Toast Engine / YeahToast!

### Hello, well-done bread lovers!

###### or as my French colleague would say,

![Bonjour!][French Toast]

### So, what is this anyway?

##### A python-based game engine!

What began as a little experiment in graphics with 
Python, I am developing into a simple 2D game engine using 
PyGame, with physics, graphics, menus and 
sounds galore!

The engine features Newtonian kinematics and an 
adorably toasty theme! As I progress I will be developing 
games based on the engine, like [Ana the Anaconda][Ana].
